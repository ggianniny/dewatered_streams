## Dewatered Streams Project README
#### Updated 05/30/2023 by Gordon Gianniny

This repository contains code to analyze stream gauge records from "dewatered" rivers in the Upper Colorado River basin and produce figures for the Utah State University Center for Colorado River Studies fact sheet titled "Dewatered Rivers of the Upper Colorado River Basin."

All analyses are carried out by the **dewatered_stream_calcs.Rmd** script. As stated in the script, Dewatered rivers were selected from Jack Schmidt's "JCS_Streamflow_Summary" Excel sheet as any gauge with a 21st century mean annual flow of less than 60% of the 1930-1949 mean annual flow. Figures created in this script are stored in the **plots** folder.
